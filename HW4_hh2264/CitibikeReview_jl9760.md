First of all, I think he did a great job on this project.
Null Hypothesis(N0) is formulated correctly. Alternative Hypothesis(N1) is formulated correctly.
The data supports the project. The data has all the features that can help answer the question.
The plot he used clearly shows the comparison between male and female riders.
He did a really good job on the visualization.
What I would add into the plot are a title and a label for yaxis(only the first plot).
I think the ANOVA statistical analysis is suitable for this question. It can tell us if there is a difference 
between men and women riders in terms of the tripduration.
