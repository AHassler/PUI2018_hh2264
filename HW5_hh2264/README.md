For Assignment 1, I followed the prompts in the skeleton notebook to learn and run different functions in pandas dataframe. I also leaned to work with regional land use type data to present tables and compare different land use features in different boroughs in NYC.

For Assignment 2, I built up on what we learned of SQL language in class to adapt different prompts. I got to treat CitiBike data with different data type sorting and hunting in dimensions like time, space, and use load, etc.
